# Hackerfaq
This is like a GUI for [gleitz/howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) and it's a clone of [DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack](http://www.github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack).

## Issue
I guess stack overflow ban the program after a few hundred requests, so how .py should overcome that.
