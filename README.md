# hackerfaq
This is like a GUI for [gleitz/howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) and it is a clone of [DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack](http://www.github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack).

## Issue
I guess stackoverflow bans the program after a few hundred requests, so how.py should overcome that.
